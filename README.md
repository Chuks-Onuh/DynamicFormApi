# DynamicFormApi
A dynamic form generator that fetches customer-specific fields based on their account number and industry. The project includes a RESTful API to retrieve the fields and a front-end web page that dynamically generates the form based on the API response. Ideal for capturing additional information from corporate customers during transactions.
